Prerequisites:
•  Learn as much as possible about container technologies such as OCI,
Podman, and Docker.

Description:
•  Install Podman.

•  Use a Dockerfile to install the necessary tools for compiling the C++
"Hello, World!" program.

•  Create a Debian 12 ("debian12") rootless container image from a
Dockerfile using the command: "podman build -t debian12 -f
Dockerfile-debian12".

•  Compile and run the C++ "Hello, World!" program inside the "debian12"
container using Podman.

•  Find a method to run the OpenSSH server (sshd) inside the container.

•  Optionally, run the OpenSSH server (sshd) in the container in debug
mode (e.g., `/usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 2222`).


Proof of successful task completion:
1. Document all commands used and files modified.

2. Connect from your Linux host to the SSH server running in the container.

3. Optionally, use the debug mode for the SSH client and analyze the
console output.


Deliverables:
Provide the following files for download from GitHub:

•  "task3-hello.txt" and "Dockerfile-debian12" (for item 1).

•  "task3-ssh.txt" (for item 2).
